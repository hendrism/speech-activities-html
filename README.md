# Speech Therapy Activities Hub

Welcome to your centralized speech therapy activities system!

<!-- Note: The Codex CLI sandbox blocks `/bin/ps`, so you'll see a harmless "Operation not permitted" message whenever commands source the Homebrew environment. -->

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
2. Browse activities by category or search
3. Click any activity to launch it

That's it! Everything works in your browser.
