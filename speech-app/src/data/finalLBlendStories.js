            "Liam woke up early and pulled on his thick quilt. The air felt cold, and frost covered the field behind his house. He built a small fire in the fireplace to help warm up the room. His mom poured him a glass of milk while they watched the sun rise over the hills.",
            "After breakfast he pulled on his coat and belt and went outside to feed the calf. The metal pail felt cold, so he held it with a glove. Liam walked across the field and helped his neighbor stack wood on the shelf by the shed."

            "On the hill by the fence, the wind felt cold and sharp. Mila held the rope while her dad fixed a split board with a new bolt. Back at the barn, they filled a small pail with warm milk to help the calf feel calm."
