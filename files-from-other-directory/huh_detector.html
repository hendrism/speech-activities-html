    <title>The 'Huh?' Detector: An Interactive Guide</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a tab-based single-page app. A top navigation bar allows users to switch between three core categories: Non-Verbal, Verbal, and Action-Based signals. This thematic structure is more intuitive than a long scroll, allowing the user to focus on one type of cue at a time. The content within each tab is presented as a grid of interactive cards. Users click on a card to "reveal" the meaning behind a signal, transforming passive reading into active discovery. This design was chosen to be highly engaging for a high school audience, mobile-friendly, and to make the information more memorable through interaction. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source report's qualitative data is organized into categories. The goal is to inform and organize this information for easy learning. Instead of static tables, interactive cards are used. Each card represents a signal. Interaction is an on-click event that reveals detailed text. This is more engaging than a table and works better on all screen sizes. Unicode characters (emojis) are used as simple, friendly icons to add visual cues without using image files or SVG. This entire structure is built with HTML/Tailwind and powered by vanilla JavaScript for the interactions. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

When you spot one of these signs, it’s your cue to pause, try explaining it a different way, and check if they understand.
